00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.200
To whom should I tell my sorrow, o clouds?

2
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.220
People who we regard as brothers hurt us deeply

3
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.880
And then there is homesickness, which hurts the most

4
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.100
Tell me, are there news from the homeland?

5
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.300
Are these rains perhaps the tears of my beloved?

6
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.800
Tell me, are there news from the homeland?

7
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.680
Are these rains perhaps the tears of my beloved?

8
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:09.700
I am burning inside, my wound is deep

9
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.420
Bring me some news from my delicate beloved

10
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.460
I am burning inside, my wound is deep

11
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.440
Bring me some news from my delicate beloved

12
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.760
Clouds, say hello to my love

13
00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.480
Tell her that the day of reunion is near

14
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.320
If fate sent me far away from my love

15
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.100
What can I do abroad all alone?

16
00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.780
Tell me, is it possible to live far away from love?

17
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.200
What can I do abroad all alone?

18
00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.340
Tell me, is it possible to live far away from love?

19
00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.360
I am burning inside, my wound is deep

20
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.720
Bring me some news from my delicate beloved

21
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.480
I am burning inside, my wound is deep

22
00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.360
Bring me some news from my delicate beloved
